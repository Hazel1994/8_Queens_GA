this is the implementation of 8-Queens problem using Genetic algorithm in Java

the jar file is available in the dist folder.

I have written it in NetBeans IDE as you can see the packages. 

when you run the program you should see a frame as follows:

here , you can easily set the parameters and run the algorithm.
after you hit "Statt the algorith" it will show you the best chromosome(solution).
it might be soimething like this:

you can also check "continue untill the answer is found" to make sure the algorithm finds a solution:
