this is the implementation of 8-Queens problem using Genetic algorithm in Java

the jar file is available in the dist folder.

I have written it in NetBeans IDE as you can see the packages. 

when you run the program you should see a frame as follows:

![Alt text](relative/images/g1.png?raw=true "Title")
